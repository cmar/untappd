        wouldn''t be any more. For us. And that was simply unacceptable. So, we are

        \/ Double IPA","beer_description":"This year our brewing team was inspired
        by some exotic-ish additions of the lemony persuasion. Yes, it''s a Double
        IPA (can you really say you''re surprised?), but as we strive to do with all
        our Stone Anniversary Ales of the let''s-take-this-IPA-in-a-new-direction
        variety, we''ve brewed up a Stone-worthy divergence from tradition. The amount
        of rye malt we used isn''t quite enough to warrant the appellation \"Rye IPA,\"
        but it still adds hints of spiciness that contrast deliciously with the tropical
        fruit flavors and aromas of the Amarillo and Calypso hops. Add a few European
        specialty malts, some lemon verbena, and three more hop varieties to the mix,
        and you have a highly complex brew melding both bitter and fruity hop notes
        with rich toasted malt character punctuated by nuances of spicy rye and subtle
        lemon.\n\nAppearance:\nBeautiful light amber with a thick creamy tan head
        of foam.\nAroma:\nAn incredible blend of fruits: citrus, lemon, and peaches,
        with hints of mint and dry-roasted nutty malt flavors.\nTaste:\nA very clean
        maltiness, intense peachy\/mango Amarillo hops, hints of apples and berries,
        finishing in a burst of fresh lemon, hop bitterness, and herbal spiciness.\nPalate:\nSmooth
        and complex malt flavors, medium body, the very slightest hint of alcohol
        heat, with a refreshingly bitter and citrusy finish.\nOverall:\nFrom the first
        time I smelled a broken leaf from a lemon verbena bush at Stone Farms, I thought
        its intense lemony character would be a great addition to an IPA. It truly
        is \"more lemon than lemon.\" The lemon flavors combine wonderfully with the
        peach and tropical mango flavors from the Amarillo, and the apple and berry
        notes from the Calypso hops. The result is an intense, bitter and very refreshing
        take on a double IPA. Perfect for a Southern California summer.","created_at":"Mon,

        Simple enough. Well, we at Stone have identified gravitational forces in the
        beer world. And we have come to the conclusion that they, well, see above.
        So we avoid these less-than-desirable gravitational forces. We avoid dumbed-down
        flavor profiles and the vigorous pursuit of the lowest common denominator.
        We avoid big dollar marketing mentalities. We avoid additives, cheap adjuncts,
        stabilizers, and chemical preservatives. So in the defiance of gravity we
        bring you Stone Levitation Ale. This deep amber ale has rich malt flavors,
        a big hoppy character, citrus overtones (courtesy of the hops and our special
        brewers yeast), and modest alcohol. ","created_at":"Sat, 21 Aug 2010 07:26:35
